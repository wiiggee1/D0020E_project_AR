# Gamification of evacuation drills
This project is made during the third-year project course for computer engineering students at Luleå University of Technology. The course aims to develop students within software development and prepare for practices within the industry.

## Project description 
For our project an augmented reality (AR) game was created with the aim to generate research data on flow patterns in emergency situations. The game scenes an unguided fire evacuation drill with time pressure, a fire alarm bell ringing, additional obstacles such as fire and smoke. These features were added to make the evacuation drill as realistic and stressful as possible to ensure that the data collected also reflects the reality of an evacuation drill.

A website was created to visualize the data collected….. Add more information about the webpage
